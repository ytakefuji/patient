This is under review.

Patients need to know effects of medication and exercise for alleviating diseases. 
Biomarkers are used to monitor the status of diseases.

phope.py (patient for hospital observation and predicting effects of medication and exercise.)
is used for evaluating the performance and predicting values of biomarkers in the next hospital visit.

data.csv is a data file composed of six determinants such as day (date of tested), hbA1c (biomarker for diabetes), NT-proBNP (biomarker for heart failure), degree1 (polynomial regression for hbA1c), and degree2 (polynomial regression for NT-proBNP).

Based on data.csv, phope.py can calculate and predict values of biomarkers for the next visit.

Predicting biomarker values allows patients to know the progress and trends of improvement in their diseases. 

Predictive values are hopes of patients.
